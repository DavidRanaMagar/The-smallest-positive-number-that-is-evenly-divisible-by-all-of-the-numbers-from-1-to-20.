Algorithm
I have used recursive method to solve the problem: to find the smallest positive number divisible from 1 to 20;
there are two integer parameter 1st one represent the number up to which the the given number should be divisible.
if we want to find the number divisible from 1 to 10 then the 1st parameter will be 10 and if we want to find the 
number divisible from 1 to 15 then the 1st parameter will be 15. the second parameter is the number that we compare
if that number is divisible up to given number.
i.e: a(int i,int k)

first if statement checks if the entered 1st parameter is less than or equal to 1
if true return the modulus of enter number and the divide number
if false it returns the modulus of 2nd entered parameter and 1st plus the recursive method with 1s parameter minus 1 and same 2nd parameter;

this method only return 0 if enter number is divisibled by all the value from 0 to entered 1st parameter.
i.e:
	if(i<=1) {
			return k%i;
		}
		else {
			return k%i+a(i-1,k);
		}
